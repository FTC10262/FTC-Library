Useful code for other teams to use

## MenuController, CalibrationExample
Tired of recompiling, just to change a constant? Use our calibration system
there are a couple simple examples here, but on our actual robot this year
we have almost 30 different values that we can customize – it can be really
handy – and a little dangerous.

## TimeRampValue
We also ran into a situation where we need to move values smoothly for
over a period of time – servos would try to move too quick and we needed
to slow them down. So there is a handy class that will ramp a value
across a time period smoothly which we use in a few different places.
